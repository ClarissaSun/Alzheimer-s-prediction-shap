# Prediction of Longitudinal Evolution in Alzheimer’s Disease and Driving Force Analysis with Shap

####  Project Status: [Active]

## General study goal:

+ Predict future ourcome measurements of subjects at-risk of ad enrolled in the ADNI study 

+ Use shapley value on each feature to measure the driving force of the prediction





## Detailed study design











### Data preparation
Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the [Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database] (adni.loni.usc.edu).


### Model construction


For every individual, month-by-month forecasts of three key biomarkers: 

(1) clinical status which can be either cognitively normal (CN), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or probable Alzheimer’s disease (AD);  [classification]

(2) ADAS-Cog13 (ADAS13) score;  [regression]

(3) ventricle volume (divided by intra-cranial volume). [regression]

### Model evaluation


### Model analysis










## Needs of this project

- frontend developers
- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning
- statistical modeling
- writeup/reporting
- etc. (be as specific as possible)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](Repo folder containing raw data) within this repo.

    *If using offline data mention that and how they may obtain the data from the froup)*
    
3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](Repo folder containing data processing scripts/notebooks)
4. etc...

*If your project is well underway and setup is fairly complicated (ie. requires installation of many packages) create another "setup.md" file and link to it here*  

5. Follow setup [instructions](Link to file)
